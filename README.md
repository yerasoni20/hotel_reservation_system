# Hotel Reservation System using Java 8

The hotel reservation application will allow customers to find and book a hotel room based on room availability. 
This project will demonstrate your abilities to design classes using OOP, organize and process data with collections, and use common Java types.

Main Components of the App
The major components of the Hotel Reservation Application will consist of the following:

CLI for the User Interface.
Java code. The second main component is the Java code itselfâ€”this is where to access our business logic for the app.
Java collections. Java collections for in-memory storage of the data for the app, such as the users' names, room availability, and so on.
